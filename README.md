# Nilai, The Fast One

A framework for embedded applications in modern C++.

NilaiTFO offers a framework based around the concepts of modules and application and is event-driven.

Mainly intended to be used in conjonction with [STMicro's](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html), but the complete support of most microcontroller is planned.

Under continuous development!
