 *      command's ID.

 *      It must have a typename called `payload_type`. This is the type of the `payload`. It may be
 *      `void`, primitive, `std::vector<uint8_t>`, `std::string` or any other object that is
 *      constructable from an `std::array` of `uint8_t`.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *     If `payload_type` is not void, a static constexpr member called `payload_size` of type
 *     size_t must be present. This corresponds to the size of the payload.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      If `payload_type` is not void, a member of type `payload_type` called `payload` must be
 *      present. This payload must be implicitly/explicitly convertible to
 *      `std::vector<uint8_t>`, or respecting the `Primitives` concept.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      It must have a typename called `response_type`. This it the type of the response expected
 *      to that command. It may be `void`, a primitive, `std::vector<uint8_t>`, `std::string` or
 *      any other object that is constructable from a `std::vector<uint8_t>`.
